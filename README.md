# DiskSchedulingAlgo
We will use a provided Java Maven project as a template (from the teacher). It already implements abstract DiskSchedulingAlgo base class. There is also an example of FCFS scheduling algorithm. Unit tests are also provided. Our solution should be correct, dynamic (not having static cylinder count, etc) and pass all the unit tests.  Our task is to fill code in SSTFScheduling class: process() method.
